# 👋 Hello, I'm Andrew.

I am a **Mechatronics Engineer** with a passion for bridging the gap between **hardware constraints** and **software intelligence**.

As a fresh graduate from **Nanyang Technological University (NTU)** with ***Highest Distinction (Honours)***, I have built a diverse portfolio ranging from **autonomous mobile robots** to **precision mechanical systems**. I don't just design mechanical parts. I write the code that brings them to life.

### 🚀 "Pressure is My Fuel"
I am not your typical engineer. I thrive in high-pressure environments.
* **High-Stakes Efficiency:** I turn nervousness into obsessive preparation. Whether it's a final exam or a client presentation, I leverage pressure to achieve laser-focus.
* **Rapid Learner:** I have a proven track record of absorbing complex technical modules in short sprints, consistently achieving 'A' grades.

### 🚀 What I Do

My core strength lies in **System Integration**. I thrive in environments where mechanical design, electronics, and control algorithms intersect.

* **Robotics & Control:** Experienced in **ROS (Robot Operating System)**, SLAM navigation, and PID control tuning for mobile platforms.
* **Mechanical Design:** Proficient in **SolidWorks** and **NX** for designing complex mechanisms and conducting static/dynamic simulations.
* **Embedded Systems:** Skilled in **C/C++** and **Python** for real-time processing on edge devices like **NVIDIA Jetson Nano** and **STM32**.

### 🛠 Technical Skills
* **Engineering:** Siemens NX, SolidWorks, GD&T, Mechanism Design
* **Robotics:** ROS, C++, Python, Jetson Nano, Dynamic Modelling
* **Sales:** Cold Outreach, Technical Presentation, Business Pitching
