My professional journey focuses on **Precision Engineering** and **Research**, bridging the gap between theoretical mechanics and real-world application.

## 🏢 ASMPT SMT Solutions, Singapore
**Mechanical R&D Intern | Jan '24 – Jun '24**

Working at a global leader in semiconductor assembly equipment, I focused on mechanism design and validation.
* **Mechanism Design:** Engineered the machine’s blade cutter mechanism. Calculated bending moments to determine the optimal blade thickness for a high stiffness-to-weight ratio.
* **Precision Engineering:** Applied **GD&T** and kinematic analysis using **Siemens NX** to minimize mechanical backlash.
* **Validation:** Conducted physical testing to verify structural integrity under dynamic loads.
