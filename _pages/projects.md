## 🤖 Autonomous Fall-Detection Robot (FYP)
**Role:** Final Year Project | **Stack:** NVIDIA Jetson Nano, ROS, ResNet-18 (CNN), Python

Engineered a 4-wheel chassis autonomous mobile robot designed to detect elderly falls in real-time.

* **Business Initiative:** Executed a cold-outreach strategy to nursing homes to validate market need, securing a research collaboration and sponsorship from **St. Luke's ElderCare**.
* **AI & Vision:** Implemented an AI Inference model using **ResNet-18 CNN** optimized for the Jetson Nano to classify falls.
* **Control:** Developed control algorithms using motor encoder feedback to ensure precise navigation accuracy based on ResNet model obstacle detection.
* **Optimization:** Tuned the deep neural network architecture for simultaneous computer-vision based fall classification and obstacle avoidance.

## 🏎️ Maze Escape Simulation (Personal Project)
**Role:** Algorithm Design | **Stack:** C++, Bicycle Model Dynamics

Developed a C++ simulation of an autonomous robot navigating a maze to random goals.

* **The Challenge:** The robot needed to navigate narrow corridors in a generated maze without hitting obstacles or losing localization.
* **The Solution:** * Implemented a feedback control loop based on **Bicycle Model Dynamics** to achieve realistic motion control.
    * Integrated simulated proximity sensors for robust, real-time obstacle detection.
* **The Result:** Successfully navigated the maze autonomously.
